# Introduction

Kit is a collection of components for developing, documenting, and testing React component libraries.
It provides components for library views, styleguides, and other utilities for documentation and testing.

## Components over configuration

Kit avoids custom APIs that are specific to a given tool, instead opting for React components with a familiar API.
This is advantageous because Kit components and workflows can be gradually integrated to an existing environment.
It also allows you to continue with existing devtool-based debugging workflows.

The [Kit repo][repo] has numerous [examples][examples] showing integration with popular frameworks and UI libraries.

Read more about Kit on our [blog][blog].
